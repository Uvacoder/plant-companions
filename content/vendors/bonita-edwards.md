She has a great love and passion for Africa and enjoys getting involved with people and communities to bring out their highest aspirations. 

Among other successes, Bonita has developed murals to support the Mamelodi Greening program, and worked with the Kuthama-Sintumule community to transform plain bus stops in rural Limpopo into fabulous displays of community permaculture art. 

Bonita is the artistic talent behind Afristar’s poster series and our educational resources graphics, some of which can be seen on their website.
