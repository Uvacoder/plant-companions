Performing only her own original compositions is a brave move for anyone in the music industry. Her non-commercial, yet deeply moving lyrics and melodies have been described by the media and fellow musicians as meaningful, nourishing, igniting all the senses, unique, unpredictable, beautiful, necessary and magical.

Shomon and music are synonymous – she doesn’t play the piano, her fingers make love to the keyboard, as she transports her audience into another dimension, usually with goosebumps! 

Her voice is Shomon’s most powerful instrument, transforming her from a gentle healing angel into a powerful and raunchy “rock chick” in the space of a few bars. 

Shomon’s lyrics reflect and reveal the reality of her own personal journey through life, with her observations, feelings and emotions laid bare, allowing her audience to recognise and embrace many things within themselves. 

It is not so much a performance, but rather an awesome experience, for both the artist and her audience.
