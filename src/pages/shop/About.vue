    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>The inspiration for creating this site came from the companion plants section of the Garden.eco website. While their implementation is pretty awesome, they have a rather limited selection of plants (45 at the time of writing this), there's no search functionality and they recently started showing ads.</p>
    <p>Being that I'm a designer and front-end developer by trade and an avid gardener, I figured this would be the perfect side-project to try out some new tech.</p>
